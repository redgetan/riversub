1. subtitles overlap each other
  steps:
    click a video
    click "Edit Timecode"
    click "Cancel Edit"
    you'll see overlapping subtitles
  cause:
    $(document).on("click", "div#media_sources li", function(event) {
        syncLyricsToMedia(timecode);
    }

    code below gets executed twice. method buggy? maybe reset event handlers as a temporary mechanism

    var syncLyricsToMedia = function(timecode) {
      popcorn.subtitle({
      })
    }
