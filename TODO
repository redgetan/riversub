      c. if you don't own the youtube video

 going to videos page (http://www.riversub.cc/videos/BGDiqKuUT0E), original yt url is not obvious, plus i can't click on youtube icon in the player, why make the subtitle bar span the whole thing?

- when i hover over track, it should show me subtitle for that track
- a repo can have multiple subtitles
- can fork an existing repo


1. subtitles overlap each other
  steps:
    click a video
    click "Edit Timecode"
    click "Cancel Edit"
    you'll see overlapping subtitles
  cause:
    $(document).on("click", "div#media_sources li", function(event) {
        syncLyricsToMedia(timecode);
    }

    code below gets executed twice. method buggy? maybe reset event handlers as a temporary mechanism

    var syncLyricsToMedia = function(timecode) {
      popcorn.subtitle({
      })
    }

2. Pause sync button doesn't always work
  steps:
    click a video
    quickly click "Edit Timecode" before media starts playing
    click "start"
    click "pause"
    media won't pause

3. PositionIndicator would not go to last line
  steps:
    click "start"
    press "n" several times
    click any previous lyrics line
    when position indicator hits 2nd to last line, it would never go to last line

4. Changing start/end time beyond allowable
  should only be able to change it to:
    for start_time: max of prev start_time
    for end_time: max of next end_time

5. PositionIndicator should show current time

2. lock in lyrics line
  test mode
    click on line, locks into the line
      (diff color to indicate lock)
      play button appears
      pressing it always starts from startTime of line
    you can change start/endtime
      dblclick to change
      once its changed, to apply it,
        mechanism:
          each lyrics line contains trackEventId
          if endTime changed,
            removeTrackEvent current track and next track
            code
          if startTime changed,
            removeTrackEvent prev track and current track
            code
