1. subtitles overlap each other
  steps:
    click a video
    click "Edit Timecode"
    click "Cancel Edit"
    you'll see overlapping subtitles
  cause:
    $(document).on("click", "div#media_sources li", function(event) {
        syncLyricsToMedia(timecode);
    }

    code below gets executed twice. method buggy? maybe reset event handlers as a temporary mechanism

    var syncLyricsToMedia = function(timecode) {
      popcorn.subtitle({
      })
    }

2. Pause sync button doesn't always work
  steps:
    click a video
    quickly click "Edit Timecode" before media starts playing
    click "start"
    click "pause"
    media won't pause




2. lock in lyrics line
  test mode
    click on line, locks into the line
      (diff color to indicate lock)
      play button appears
      pressing it always starts from startTime of line
    you can change start/endtime
      dblclick to change
      once its changed, to apply it,
        mechanism:
          each lyrics line contains trackEventId
          if endTime changed,
            removeTrackEvent current track and next track
            code
          if startTime changed,
            removeTrackEvent prev track and current track
            code
